**My PhD project**

The project develops new anthropological analysis tools that combine AI with ethnographic methods and create new knowledge about the demand for cultural products. The research goal is to understand how that knowledge can be included in creative and artistic processes in ways that are recognized as meaningful by the creative actors in cultural institutions. The project thus contributes to the research front within ethical and responsible AI, which focuses on developing the technology so that it supports and expands people's scope of action, just as it contributes with new methods for computational anthropology and cultural economics.
