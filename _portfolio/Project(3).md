The project will analyse, explore and foster discussion and collaboration around the impact of artificial intelligence in democratic societies. Datafication and digitalisation are predicted to drive future growth and prosperity but have at the same time raised concerns and controversies. The pace of technological innovation is a contributing factor to the erosion of public trust in emerging technologies with trends such as populism, polarisation, and digital inequality as resulting factors. The ADD project will provide insights into and explain these connections at the same time as developing both technological and societal solutions aimed at restoring faith in technologies for the public good.
