While the world is closed down, many of us are forced to move the most basic everyday activities onto digital media and platforms. This means that we are all participating in rapid digitalization to an extent that we have not experienced before.

Brit Ross Winthereik (ITU) and Anders Kristian Munk (AAU), together with a team of talented research assistants, are creating an archive of how digitalization of everyday life actually takes place during the current corona crisis. The purpose of collecting this data is first and foremost to create an archive that can be used for future research, without having a defined end goal.

All information (interview, text, pictures and videos) is properly stored in accordance with current personal data protection legislation. You can read more about the project, and about data protection, at the bottom of the page.
