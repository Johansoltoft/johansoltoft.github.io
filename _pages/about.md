Friction by Machine: How to Slow Down Reasoning with Computational Methods
======
Written a paper together with Anders Koed Madsen & Anders Munk. The paper provides a theoretical alternative to the prevailing perception of machine learning as synonymous with speed and efficiency. Inspired by ethnographic fieldwork and grounded in pragmatist philosophy, we introduce the concept of “data friction” as the situation when encounters between held beliefs and data patterns posses the potential to stimulate innovative thinking. Contrary to the conventional connotations of “speed” and “control,” we argue that computational methods can generate a productive dissonance, thereby fostering slower and more reflective practices within organizations. Drawing on a decade of experience in participatory data design and data sprints, we present a typology of data frictions and outline three ways in which algorithmic techniques within data science can be reimagined as “friction machines”. We illustrate these theoretical points through a dive into three case studies conducted with applied anthropologist in the movie industry, urban planning, and research.

Studying Community Detection Using Twitch Emotes
======
Can emotes be seen as a kind of strange text? Twitch, the livestreaming platform, has a fast-paced chat due to its many viewers. Therefore, it's both hard to have a conversation on the platform and the words used are generally quite short - not so interesting in regards to semantic analysis. I'm thinking of another way to research this communication: focusing on emotes. Their use often seems tied to the specific stream or community. I've therefore experimented with how to create a map of a network of co-occurring emotes using Gephi
