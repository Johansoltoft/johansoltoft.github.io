Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated proficiency in composing sentences and structures that conform to grammatical precepts. Nevertheless, the utilisation of such AI in the context of cooperative narrative crafting introduces a myriad of intricacies (Santiago III et al., 2023). It is these intricate nuances we want to investigate. Prior studies have explored vast-scale datasets originating from Dungeon and Dragons gameplay scenarios (Callison-Burch et al., 2022). However, our focus centres on an explorative ethnographic inquiry of generative AI within the context of Dungeons & Dragons. We conduct two playtests: one featuring the traditional dungeon master role, and the other entrusting the narrative and storytelling responsibilities to a generative AI. These workshops offer a valuable platform for introspection, inviting us to reevaluate our perceptions of storytelling, the interplay between creativity and data-driven imagination, and ultimately, the feasibility of entrusting a generative AI as a social actor. With this study, we aim to contribute to discussions and methodological innovation that makes use of generative AI as an elicitation method, and we will present reflections about the potentials and shortcomings of using generative AI as a knowledge-producing vehicle
