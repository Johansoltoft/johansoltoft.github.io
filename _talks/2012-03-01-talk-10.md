What topics would you like to discuss with the audience for whom you are creating your film? What questions would you pose? What queries are you seeking answers to? Collaborating with Danish consultancy firm Will&Agency (W&A), known for analyzing audiences of over 65 European films, they employ mobile ethnography as a tool. This enables film writers and directors to engage with their audience during the early stages of production. Over 3000 mobile ethnography interviews have been collected, providing insights into directorial choices and character perceptions. We are currently conducting an ongoing experiment that involves inputting these interviews into an open LLM model (Yuvanesh et al., 2023), which is vector stored using Langchain and Chroma. The AI, 'The Audience Machine', has been prompted to have a film enthusiast “persona”. To evaluate its effectiveness, a series of workshops with directors, producers, and scriptwriters is being conducted. These industry professionals interact with the synthetic AI audience informant, assessing its value and limitations. Insights gleaned will enhance the 'Audience Machine', aligning its prompts more closely with observed workshop use cases. This iterative process contributes to understanding the parameters of creatively acceptable AI.
