I had the privilege of presenting the paper: 'Friction by Machine: How to Slow Down Reasoning with Computational Methods' at Hermann Hall, Illinois Institute of Technology, which I co-authored together with Anders Koed Madsen and Anders Kristian Munk. - The Techno-Anthropology Lab.
In the paper, we suggest an alternative understanding to the prevailing perception of machine learning as synonymous with speed and efficiency. Inspired by ethnographic fieldwork, we introduce "machine frictions" as the situation when encounters between held beliefs and data patterns posses the potential to stimulate innovative thinking.
