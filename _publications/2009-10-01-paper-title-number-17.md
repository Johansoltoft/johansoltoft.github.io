In the following paper we will argue how engagements with new computational techniques, such as large language models, can be viewed as a continuation of digital methods. Where digital methods seek to repurpose the methods of the web (Rogers, 2019; 2013) or see the web as both its topic and resource (Marres 2017), we argue that social scientific computational methods repurpose the methods of computer and data science as not only tools but as research objects. 

While digital methods research has never shied away from the fact that core techniques such as scraping, networks, API calls, are fundamentally computational, the proliferation of advanced computational techniques creates new avenues for digital social scientific research. Importantly however, these methods require new methodical reflections and engagement.

We will present three cases of repurposing these methods for social scientific inquiry and simultaneously illustrate a shift from traditional digital methods to social scientific computational methods.
