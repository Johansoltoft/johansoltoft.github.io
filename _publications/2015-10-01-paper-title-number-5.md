Network visualizations typically depict extended periods of time, yet they are often presented as static images, which fail to convey how discussions or controversies evolve, spike, or fade over time.

Motivated by this limitation, I embarked on a project to visualize the changing nature of discussions on Twitter regarding the national museum. The dataset comprised tweets from the time period 2015 to 2022. This analysis was possible back when the research API on Twitter was readily accessible.

The entire network was constructed using 4cat, a tool for data gathering and analysis, and was visualized and mapped in Gephi, a software for visualizing and analyzing networks. This approach allowed me to capture the dynamic fluctuations in conversation over the years, providing a more nuanced understanding of public engagement and sentiment trends related to the museum.

The visualization clearly shows how discussions on Twitter dramatically increase when the TV show "Historien om Danmark" airs on DR. Unfortunately, what I can present here is just a GIF of the visualization, as the video file is too large for this site.
