We held a workshop in ECHOlab on the theme of experimenting with large-scale etnographic data. The session began with a presentation by Brit Ross Winthereik, who introduced us to various approaches and modes of experimentation through her book, Experimenting with Ethnography. 

Following the presentation, Johan Irving Søltoft facilitated a hands-on exercise where participants transformed their ethnographic material into data scapes for further exploration. If you're interested in this approach, you can access resources and guides—from the basics of downloading Python to scripts for creating data scapes from textual data—on the GitHub page linked below:
