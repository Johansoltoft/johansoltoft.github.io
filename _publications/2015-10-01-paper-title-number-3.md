Can emotes be seen as a kind of strange text? Twitch, the livestreaming platform, has a fast-paced chat due to its many viewers. Therefore, it’s both hard to have a conversation on the platform and the words used are generally quite short - not so interesting in regards to semantic analysis. I’m thinking of another way to research this communication: focusing on emotes. Their use is tied to the specific stream or community. I’ve therefore experimented with how to create a map of a network of co-occurring emotes using Gephi.
