"Datafantasi" was co-written with Anders Madsen and Ann-Sofie, but it also draws heavily on five years of teaching in the Master in Data-Driven Organization (MDO) program, where both students and co-teachers have contributed their perspectives.

The chapter introduces the Data Diamond as a heuristic tool for analyzing and mapping data situations. We illustrate the model with a case from Helsingør Municipality, where, a few years ago, semantic analysis was used to understand student well-being as part of an MDO project.

Our aim with the chapter is to develop a conceptual framework for discussing data projects as opportunities for learning rather than as instruments of control. In this way, we seek to decouple data from New Public Management and open up new ways of imagining data work within organizations.
