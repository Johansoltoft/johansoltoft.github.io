Can we enable direct interviewing of a qualitative corpus through Generative AI to prolong ethnographic encounters?

This was one of the key topics we deliberated upon during the MASSHINE Generative Ethnographic AI retreat. The event spanned two intense and enjoyable days, during which we experimented with various models and approaches to Generative AI.

The project's objective is to enable direct interviewing of a qualitative corpus, making large qualitative datasets accessible without the lengthy process of coding and second-hand reporting. Interacting with a trained chatbot can offer a new immersion into the material. During the retreat, we focused on enabling AI-curated access to qualitative interviews to generate new insights.
