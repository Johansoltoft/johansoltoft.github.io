Creating AI-generated videos in the audiovisual media sector is a topic steeped in controversy, as highlighted during events such as the WGA strikes and instances like Disney’s use of an AI-generated image for its centennial celebration on Instagram, which sparked intense debates about the company's future.

At the "Picture_This" conference, a hub for emerging film technologies, one of the most discussed topics was AI in film. A notable presentation by Nick Laurent delved into the practical challenges of AI in film production. He shared insights into the extensive process of creating a short scene, emphasizing the iterative nature of the work which involved using over eight different software programs. His talk illustrated the necessity for constant tinkering and adjustments to achieve quality results.

Inspired by Laurent’s discussion, I became intrigued to explore this field myself. I decided to produce a brief scene visualizing Donna Haraway's phrase "in the belly of the monster"

My experiment

In my small experiment, the images were generated using DALL·E 3 and then transformed into short film segments with Runway. One aspect that intrigued me was the challenge of maintaining consistency when generating images with DALL·E 3. Achieving the desired look for just this brief video required numerous minor adjustments. For instance, I uploaded a reference photo to enhance consistency or reusing the same prompts to refine the output.

Another observation was the use of Runway, which proved most effective for depicting subtle movements. Attempting to create large movements often resulted in a distorted video, revealing the limitations of current AI tools in handling dynamic scenes.

Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see how the upcoming release of Sora influences this field, also considering the potential environmental impact its operation may necessitate.
