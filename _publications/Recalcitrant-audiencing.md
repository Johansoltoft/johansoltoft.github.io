This article explores the evolution of audience analytics in filmmaking in the context of digital platforms and AI.
We propose the term 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘤𝘪𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘪𝘯𝘨 to describe a mode of audience engagement that resists confirming filmmakers’ assumptions, instead challenging dominant ideas about who the audience is or should be. In place of a docile, knowable audience, we trace the emergence of one that is intentionally recalcitrant- ambivalent, heterogeneous, and constructed to be troubling.

The article is part of the special issue “Big Data Audiences”.
