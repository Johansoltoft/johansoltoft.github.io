======
This paper provides a theoretical alternative to the prevailing perception of machine learning as synonymous with speed and efficiency. Inspired by ethnographic fieldwork and grounded in pragmatist philosophy, we introduce the concept of "data friction" as the situation when encounters between held beliefs and data patterns posses the potential to stimulate innovative thinking. Contrary to the conventional connotations of "speed" and "control," we argue that computational methods can generate a productive dissonance, thereby fostering slower and more reflective practices within organizations. Drawing on a decade of experience in participatory data design and data sprints, we present a typology of data frictions and outline three ways in which algorithmic techniques within data science can be reimagined as "friction machines". We illustrate these theoretical points through a dive into three case studies conducted with applied anthropologist in the movie industry, urban planning, and research. 

Method
======
We draw inspiration from Agar. He posits that ethnography isn't solely about gathering data or extracting knowledge from a field site. It's also about putting one's perspective on the line (Agar, 2006). This means that through fieldwork, one's inherent understanding or frame is transformed, through frictions! 
In contrast, data science is often perceived as purely extractive—a rapid method of discerning patterns without challenging one's viewpoint. As a result, there's no alteration in one's own understanding., this lack of transformation means it cannot be considered ethnography.
We propose that machine learning can be employed in an ethnographic manner, a concept we term "Machine Anthropology." This aligns with the objectives of traditional in-depth ethnography. The goal is to induce friction via algorithmic and data processes, prompting individuals to reassess their perspectives, thus generating both emic and etic frictions.

Friction Machines
------
**Algorithmic friction**
“algorithmic misprediction is used as a tactic to identify ambiguous and rich cases where thick description is necessary”

**Visual friction**
“Visualizations deliberately built to indicate vague structures that require more investigation to be meaningful. In that sense they stimulate explicit guessing and sense-making in the presence of others”

**Curated friction**
“The contemporary data environment is way more granular and messier than its predecessors, data projects often involve decisions about what to keep as data points and how to operationalize concepts”
